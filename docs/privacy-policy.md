# Privacy Policy for Mimic

Last updated: 2026.01.22


## 1. Introduction  
Mimic (the "Extension") is a web testing and web automation tool designed to assist users with browser-based testing and automation tasks. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is handled.  


## 2. Data Collection  
The Extension **does not collect, store, transmit, or process any user data** of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Personal information (e.g., names, emails, addresses)  
- Browsing history, cookies, or website data  
- Device information (e.g., hardware details, operating system, IP address)  
- User inputs, interactions, or automation scripts created/used via the Extension  


## 3. Data Usage  
Since the Extension does not collect any data, there is no usage of user data. All automation and testing operations are performed locally within your browser, with no data sent to external servers or third parties.  


## 4. Third-Party Sharing  
The Extension does not share any user data with third parties, as no data is collected or stored to begin with.  


## 5. User Control Over Data  
You retain full control over all actions performed via the Extension. Any temporary data generated during automation/testing (e.g., in-memory scripts or session-specific inputs) is cleared when the browser session ends or when you disable/remove the Extension. You can manage or clear Extension-related data at any time via your browser's extension settings.  


## 6. Third-Party AI Integration  
The Extension allows users to integrate third-party AI services by entering a custom `baseURL`, `apiKey`, and `model` provided by the user.  

- Any `apiKey`, `baseURL`, or other credentials entered by the user will be stored locally on the user’s browser to maintain the integration setup between browser sessions. This storage is restricted to the user’s local device and is not transmitted to the Extension’s developer or any external server, except when explicitly used to facilitate connections to the user-specified third-party AI service.  
- These credentials are used solely to enable communication with the user-chosen third-party AI service. The Extension does not process, access, or use these credentials for any purpose beyond maintaining the user’s configured integration.  
- Data processed by the third-party AI service (including inputs, outputs, or metadata) is governed by the privacy policy of that third-party service. The Extension does not control or monitor how third-party AI services handle such data.  
- Users are solely responsible for reviewing the privacy policy and terms of service of any third-party AI service they integrate, and for ensuring compliance with applicable laws regarding data shared with such services. The developer of Mimic extension shall not be liable for any privacy issues, data breaches, or misuse of data arising from the user’s use of third-party AI services.  
- Users may manage or delete stored credentials at any time via the Extension’s settings or by clearing Extension data through their browser’s built-in extension management tools.
